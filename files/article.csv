Clues contained in ancient brain point to the origin of heads in early animals (Biologynews),http://news.feedzilla.com/en_us/stories/science/435537929?client_source=api&format=json,"
This is _Odaraia alata_, an arthropod resembling a submarine from the middle
Cambrian Burgess Shale. A new study from the University of Cambridge has
identified one of the oldest fossil brains ever discovered - more than 500
million years old - and used it to help determine how heads first evolved in
early animals. The results, published today (7 May) in the journal _Current
Biology_, identify a key point in the evolutionary transition from soft to
hard bodies in early ancestors of arthropods, the group that contains modern
insects, crustaceans and spiders.

Examining Costs and Prices For California's High-Speed Rail Project,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/91vPO0UpT1M/examining-costs-and-prices-for-californias-high-speed-rail-project,"The L.A. Times features a look at the contentious issue of a publicly funded high-speed rail system for travel within the state of California, which focuses especially on an obvious question: how much would it cost for passengers to ride? This isn't a straightforward answer, though, partly because the system isn't expected to be operational for another 13 years, and the estimates vary wildly for what would be a trip of more than 400 miles that touches on some of the U.S.'s most expensive real estate. From the Times' article:

""The current $86 fare [for an L.A. to San Francisco ticket] is calculated in 2013 dollars based on a formula that prices tickets at 83% of average airline fares to help attract riders. The rail fare is an average that includes economy and premium seats, nonstop and multi-stop trains, as well as last-minute and advance purchase tickets. A premium, same-day nonstop bullet train trip would cost more than $86.

But compared with current average prices on several high-speed rail systems in Asia and Europe, $86 would be a bargain, equating to about 20 cents a mile or less, the Times review found. The analysis was based on a 438-mile route in the mid-range of what state officials expect the final alignment to measure.""

The source of this conclusion is data gathered prior to the crash of NASA's Messenger probe into Mercury's surface on April 30 of this year. Says the story:

The researchers analyzed magnetic data collected by MESSENGER in the fall of 2014 and 2015, when the spacecraft flew incredibly close to the planet's surface, at altitudes as low as 9 miles (15 kilometers). In contrast, the lowest that MESSENGER flew in previous years was between 125 and 250 miles (200 and 400 km). ... The scientists detected magnetized rocks in a part of Mercury's crust that, due to the presence of many craters from cosmic impacts, appears to be quite ancient. The researchers suggest the rocks were once magnetized by the planet's magnetic field, and based on the age and amount of the magnetized rocks, as well as how strongly they were magnetized, the investigators deduced that Mercury's magnetic field has persisted for 3.8 billion years.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

The two-day poker showdown involving four of the world's top (human) players and a Carnegie Mellon University AI program called Claudico saw the professionals win, after several days of heads-up no-limit Texas Hold'em. ""Despite the win, the poker players' $732,713 collective lead over Claudico wasn't quite large enough to attain statistical significance, experts have said. This means that the results can't be accepted as scientifically reliable thereby indicating that the ""Brains Vs. Artificial Intelligence"" competition effectively ended in a statistical tie.""

Prison Messaging System JPay Withdraws Copyright Claims,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/jww_nyoK2wc/prison-messaging-system-jpay-withdraws-copyright-claims,"Florida-based JPay has a specialized business model and an audience that is at least in part a (literally) captive one: the company specializes in logistics and communications services involving prisons and prisoners, ranging from payment services to logistics to electronic communications with prisoners. Now, via Cory Doctorow at Boing Boing comes a report from the EFF that the company has back-pedaled on a particularly strange aspect of the terms under which the company provided messaging services for prisoners: namely, JPay's terms of service made exhaustive copyright claims on messages sent by prisoners, claiming rights to ""all content, whether it be text, images, or video"" send via the service. That language has now been excised, but not in time to prevent at least one bad outcome; from the EFF's description: 
[Valerie] Buford has been running a social media campaign to overturn her [brother, Leon Benson's] murder conviction. However, after Buford published a videogram that her brother recorded via JPay to Facebook, prison administrators cut off her access to the JPay system, sent Benson to solitary confinement, and stripped away some of his earned ""good time."" To justify the discipline, prison officials said they were enforcing JPay's intellectual property rights and terms of service.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Researchers Discover Breakthrough Drug Delivery Method By Changing Shape of Pill,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/GdokyVIPsK0/researchers-discover-breakthrough-drug-delivery-method-by-changing-shape-of-pill,"ErnieKey writes: Researchers at the UCL School of Pharmacy, University College London have found a way to change the rate of dissolution within medication via a 3D printing method. Researchers used MakerBot's water- soluble filament, cut it into tiny pieces and mixed in acetaminophen. They then used the Filabot extruder to extrude a drug infused filament. With this filament they printed odd shaped pills and tested them to see what effect different shapes had on the speed at which they dissolved. What they concluded was that these odd shaped pills allowed for different rates of absorption, enabling custom medications for patients.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Texas Regulators Crack Down on App-Driven Hauling Service,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/q1SPUJ8Lvlk/texas-regulators-crack-down-on-app-driven-hauling-service,"According to the Austin American-Statesman, it's not just ride-sharing companies like Uber drawing attention from regulators, at least in Texas, but also a similar service that's hauling goods rather than people. In a letter demanding that Austin-based Burro cease its phone-coordinated delivery service, Texas Department of Motor Vehicles
director of enforcement William P. Harbeson says that ""[a]nyone moving household goods in a pick-up truck or other type or size of vehicle for hire is required to register"" with the Department, ""and show proof of insurance in the amounts required by law."" According to the letter, this includes not just professional or even regular haulers, but also people moving a piece of furniture bought at a garage sale for pay; considering the number of people offering that kind of service on Austin's Craigslist, or in the parking lot of home supply stores like Home Depot, it seems like a regulation that will put a dent in the wallet of quite a few people. Burro, for its part, says its providers ""are backed by $1M in insurance"" &mdash; more than can be said for one of the obvious substitutes, which is relying on friends or acquaintances with a roof-rack and some bungie cords.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">

Witnesses reported seeing an explosion, as well as (according to NBC News) a ""huge ball of black smoke"" when the transformer exploded, which led to the shut-down of the site's Unit 3.

WHO Declares Liberian Ebola Outbreak Over,http://rss.slashdot.org/~r/Slashdot/slashdot/~3/wTYXroXxwG0/who-declares-liberian-ebola-outbreak-over,"The Washington Post reports that after 42 days with no new cases of Ebola infection in Liberia, the World Health Organization has declared over the outbreak which killed more than 4,000 people in that country; 42 days means twice the known maximum incubation period for the disease, though scientists' understanding of the virus's persistence continues to evolve. From the WHO's statement: Health officials have maintained a high level of vigilance for new cases. During April, the country&rsquo;s 5 dedicated Ebola laboratories tested around 300 samples every week. All test results were negative. 

While WHO is confident that Liberia has interrupted transmission, outbreaks persist in neighbouring Guinea and Sierra Leone, creating a high risk that infected people may cross into Liberia over the region&rsquo;s exceptionally porous borders.<p><div class=""share_submission"" style=""position:relative;"">
